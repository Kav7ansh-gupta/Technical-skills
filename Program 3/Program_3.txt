Question>>>> Given an integer array A of size n. in 1 sec you can increase the value of 1 element by 1 find the minimum time in seconds to make all elements of thye array equal.

example: 
        A = {2,4,5,7,9,3}
        time = 25.


observation:
1... To minimize time to make all elements equal to the maximum element of the array.


step 1 ... find the maximum element in the array.
step 2 ... for element calcualte how much it need to be increased to reach the maximum
step 3 ... Sum all those difference.
